I am Associate Professor of Econometrics and Statistics at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business. I work at the intersections of economics, statistics, and machine learning.

## Class Material

### BUSN 41901 Probability and Statistics

> This is a PhD course that introduces fundamental statistical concepts for academic research in business and economics. [[Lecture Notes]](https://kajitetsuya.github.io/41901notes.pdf)

## Working Papers

### [Assessing Heterogeneity of Treatment Effects](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.15048)

> Treatment effect heterogeneity is important in economics. We introduce bounds on two measures of heterogeneity that complement quantile treatment effects. The first measure is the subgroup treatment effect, which is the average treatment effect for the subgroup defined by a range of _Y_<sub>0</sub>. The second measure is the subgroup proportion of winners, which is the share of those whose _Y_<sub>1</sub> is greater than _Y_<sub>0</sub> in the same subgroup. (with Jianfei Cao)

### [Controlling Tail Risk Measures with Estimation Error](https://kajitetsuya.github.io/risk.pdf)

> Financial risk control involves estimation of risk. If risk intends to control the probability of bad events, we construct a way to control the "true risk" exploiting the knowledge of estimation error. Such risk measures, named tail risk measures, include Value-at-Risk and expected shortfall. An empirical application controls expected shortfall in portfolio management. (with Hyungjune Kang)

### [Asymptotic Theory of _L_-Statistics and Integrable Empirical Processes](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.07572)

> Asymptotics of _L_-statistics can be tricky in some applications. I develop a new way to characterize them using integrable empirical processes and functional delta methods. Bootstrap validity is also shown. Applications to outlier robustness analysis.
